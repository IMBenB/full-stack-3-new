Hi, welcome to the CSS-HTML work-exam.

Open a new branch in gitdesktop;

Create a responsive site based on the pictures in this folder.

Finish it as fast as you can, and commit when you finished. Scores will be given base on speed and accuracy.

All tests should be submitted (push) by 13:30 Friday 20/3/20

Work with ease and style :-)
